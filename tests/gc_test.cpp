// the main case is the cycle gc_collect() exists to break: a closure stored in a variable inside its own captured
// scope. once make_thing() returns, nothing but the cycle keeps that scope alive, so gc_collect() must clear it.
// gc_scope_count() dropping afterwards is the visible proof, since a script can't ask whether one scope is alive
